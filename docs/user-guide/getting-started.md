# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.99.3+
- GitHub Copilot (for using prompts)

## Installation

Search "AI Primitives Hub" in VS Code Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and click Install.

Alternatively, install directly from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmadeusITGroup.prompt-registry). You will be prompted to authenticate with GitHub — click Allow and sign in.

## First Launch: GitHub Account and Hub Selection

On first launch, AI Primitives Hub shows a welcome dialog to help you get started:

1. **GitHub Account** — If you have multiple GitHub accounts signed in to VS Code, AI Primitives Hub asks which one to use. Pick the account that has access to the hub or sources you need. If only one account is signed in, you can still add another from the same picker. Cancelling this step leaves the extension in a "Setup Not Complete" state; on the next launch you will see a "Would you like to resume?" prompt. You can also re-pick later by running the **AI Primitives Hub: Force GitHub Authentication** command (`promptregistry.forceGitHubAuth`) from the Command Palette.

2. **Hub Selector** — Choose from available hubs:
   - Pre-configured hubs (verified for availability)
   - Custom Hub URL (enter your own)
   - Skip for now (configure later)

3. **Automatic Setup** — When you select a hub:
   - The hub is imported and set as active
   - Sources defined in the hub are synced
   - The first profile is auto-activated (if available)
   - Awesome Copilot source is added automatically

4. **Ongoing Sync** — On each VS Code startup, the active hub is automatically synced to keep your configuration up-to-date.

To reset and re-trigger the first-run experience: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "AI Primitives Hub: Reset First Run"

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Pick GitHub Account, then Select Hub** — Choose which GitHub account to use, then pick a hub from the welcome dialog (or skip)
2. **Open Marketplace** — Click the AI Primitives Hub icon in the Activity Bar
3. **Browse** — Search or filter by tags/source
4. **Install** — Click a bundle tile → Install
5. **Use** — Prompts appear in Copilot Chat as `/<bundle-id>-<prompt-id>`

User-level primitives are installed under the generic Copilot directory: `~/.copilot/` on macOS and Linux, or `%USERPROFILE%\.copilot\` on Windows. Prompts, agents, instructions, skills, hooks, and plugins use their corresponding subdirectories. When running in Kiro, the extension uses Kiro's user layout under `~/.kiro/`, including `~/.kiro/agents/` and `~/.kiro/skills/`, and applies Kiro-specific agent transformations.

## Add Your Own Source

1. Registry Explorer → Add Source
2. Choose type: `github`, `local`, `awesome-copilot`, `local-awesome-copilot`, `apm`, or `local-apm`
3. Enter URL/path
